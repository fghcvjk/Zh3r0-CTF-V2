Welcome to your basic cryptanalysis tutorial
There would be 8 levels, each level bringing something new on
the plate. I would be generous enough to let you encrypt any
string of your choice. Once you figure out the encryption,
submit the flag to proceed to the next level.

Level: 1, encrypted flag: 69666d6d70217870736d6522214d667574216866752168706a6f68

[1] Encrypt
[2] Submit level flag
